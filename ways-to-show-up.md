# Ways to Show Up

Here are some ways you can show up for racial justice.

## Contact Your Representatives

Contacting your representatives about issues you care about is a great way to let your voice be heard. If possible, it can be more effective to call rather than email (see [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/heres-why-you-should-call-not-email-your-legislators.html){: target="_blank"} on why). Here are some resources to help you contact your representatives:

- [Find your Iowa Legislators](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find){: target="_blank"}
- [Find your Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/){: target="_blank"}
- [Find your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/senators_cfm.cfm?State=IA){: target="_blank"}
- [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/){: target="_blank"}: This is a resource that makes it easy to call your representatives about important issues. It lists current issues with information about them, gives you a script if you need one, and gives you contact information for who to call.

## Attend Events Related to Racial Justice

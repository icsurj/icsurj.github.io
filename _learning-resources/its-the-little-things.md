Although we no longer live in a legally segregated society, the division between blacks and whites never seems to go away. We work together, go to school together, and live near each other, but beneath it all there is a level of misunderstanding that breeds mistrust and a level of miscommunication that generates anger. This is Lena Williams' honest look at the interactions between blacks and whites -- the gestures, expressions, tones, and body language that keep us divided.

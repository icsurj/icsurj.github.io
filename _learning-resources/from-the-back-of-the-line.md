From the Back of the Line aims to increase awareness of the impact of U.S. immigration policies on families, and to add dimensionality to the national public discourse surrounding the U.S. immigration system. The film documents the struggles of individuals caught in low-priority deportation procedures, parents raising mixed-status families, and high school and college-aged students who have lived in the United States since childhood.

The Iowa City, IA chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice (ICSURJ) joins the Women’s March in opposing the hateful rhetoric of the recent electoral campaign and defending the principles of human rights, dignity, and justice for all, regardless of race, immigration status, religious faith, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability status. As a group of individuals organizing white people to act as a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability, ICSURJ calls on our fellow Iowans to support the rights of all women and to fight for the intersectional needs of women of color in this state and in this country. We must remember, as stated in the mission of the Women’s March, "We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us."

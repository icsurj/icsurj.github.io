The African American Council (AAC) seeks to improve the quality of life for black faculty, staff, and students at the University of Iowa.  Recognizing the challenges that the campus environment poses, the AAC provides a safe space where black community members can explore their concerns.  The organization uses insights from these explorations to create programming and to lobby for policies.

Through service on committees, engagement with the broader community, and hosting responsive events, AAC members show that they are enthusiastic partners in the University of Iowaâ€™s quest to remain a top-flight educational institution.  We invite you to join us in this worthy enterprise.

The purpose of the Iowa City Mosque (Masjid Al-Iman) is to carry out worship, educational, and charitable activities in the Iowa City area, in conformity with the pure teachings of Islam based upon the Noble Qur'an, the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings be upon him), as understood and applied by his companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and those that followed them in excellence from the next two generations.

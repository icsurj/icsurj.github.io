Our desire is to develop an opportunity to have an ongoing girls group designed to empower, mentor and support self-defined minority young women as they transition through high-school. A primary focus of the group is to offer the young women, an opportunity to see and believe in their own talents and potential individually as well as academically. No matter what the circumstances are in their lives, the G! World participants will have a place to express themselves, build their confidence and articulate their very own dreams.

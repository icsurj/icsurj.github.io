This group represents the unofficial Iowa chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement. Our main objectives are as follows:

1. Educate the public about the importance of Black Lives Matter.
2. Build solidarity among Iowa's black residents.
3. Support black-owned businesses and enterprises, and generate black economic prosperity.
4. Support black families and advance black children through education, mentorship, self-esteem, and encouragement.

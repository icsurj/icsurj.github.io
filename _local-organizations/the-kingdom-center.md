"The Kingdom Center‚Äù is a multi-cultural inter-denominational ministry, a standard of living, and a movement founded on the Apostolic Doctrine. Our vision is to unify and empower Kingdom Citizens to stand uncompromisingly in defense of His Realm, His Rule and His Royalty in Faith, Love, and Power. - *1 Pet. 2:9*

We are a nonprofit religious corporation organized for the purpose of expanding and implementing the Kingdom of God on earth. This task is accomplished by carrying out the commission that Jesus Christ gave to His Apostles - *"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15).*

It is our aim to share and teach the message of the Apostolic Doctrine and the finished work of Christ by operating as a Five-Fold Ministry.

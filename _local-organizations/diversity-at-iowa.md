Diversity, broadly defined, is essential to the educational experience and central to all parts of the University's mission. The University of Iowa embraces our responsibility to create a welcoming environment for all members of the community, including underrepresented faculty, staff, and students; persons with disabilities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; persons of disadvantaged socioeconomic status; and nontraditional and international students.

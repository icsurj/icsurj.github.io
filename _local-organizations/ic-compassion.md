In 2006, ICCompassion was established as a faith-based 501c 3 nonprofit organization. Our mission is to engage culturally diverse communities together through hope, opportunities and partnerships. Together we equip people at their point of need to move out to poverty and inspire them to be of service to others. With awareness of the need for low cost legal immigration services in our community, in 2011, ICCompassion became recognized by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and Teresa Stecker became its first accredited representative providing legal immigration assistance with clients in Johnson County and surrounding counties including Cedar, Linn, Iowa, Muscatine, Washington and Scott.

The Iowa City Community Police Review Board (hereafter referred to as the CPRB) consists of five members appointed by the City Council. The CPRB has its own legal counsel. The CPRB reviews reports prepared after investigation of complaints about alleged police misconduct. It then issues its own written reports that contain detailed findings of fact and conclusions that explain why and the extent to which complaints should be sustained or not sustained. The CPRB maintains a central registry of complaints against sworn police officers and prepares annual reports to the City Council on the disposition of these complaints.

The CPRB reviews police policies, procedures, and practices, and may recommend modifications to them. The board shall hold at least one community forum each year for the purpose of hearing views on the policies, practices and procedures of the Iowa City police department.

The CPRB has only limited civil administrative review powers and has no power or authority over criminal matters or police discipline. It is not a court of law and is not intended to substitute for any form of legal action against the Police Department or the City.

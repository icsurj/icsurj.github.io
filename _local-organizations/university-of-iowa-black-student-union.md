The Black Student Union is dedicated to fostering Unity through community involvement, cultural activities, and academic excellence in the African American community at the University of Iowa. Our vision is to Rebuild, Restore, and Reorganize the Black Student Union by increasing participation within B.S.U., encouraging Retention and Recruitment and increasing recognition of the B.S.U. on The University of Iowaâ€™s Campus and the Iowa City community.

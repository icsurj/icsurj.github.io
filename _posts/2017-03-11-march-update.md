Greetings Iowa City Showing Up for Racial Justice,

For this Sunday, March 12, from 4-6 pm, we will be changing location to Room A of the Iowa City Public Library!

<!--more-->

For the first half, members of the IC SURJ leadership team will have questions for the new Iowa City Police Chief, Jody Matherly, on reducing disproportionate minority contact.

For the second half, we will break out into small groups for a play through of "&maybethewontkillyou", a role-playing "game" created by Akira Thompson, followed by time for discussion.

For more detailed information and to RSVP: [https://www.facebook.com/events/262825814170727/](https://www.facebook.com/events/262825814170727/)

Hope to see you there!

Iowa City SURJ Leadership

PS -- The ICSURJ.org website continues to develop, including a [Ways to Show Up](/ways-to-show-up/) page, and a [Stay Informed](/stay-informed/) page (the links at right expand for a wealth of local resources).

PPS -- For many in our group and many beyond our group struggling for justice, these last few weeks have been alternately trying, energizing, demoralizing, ungrounding and reconnecting.
We are in this together.  Keep showing up wherever, whenever and however you can.  

In the words of Rev. Wayne Arnason:

> Take courage friends.  
> The way is often hard,  
> the path is never clear,  
> and the stakes are very high.
>
> Take courage.  
> For deep down, there is another truth:  
> You are not alone.

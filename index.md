# Iowa City SURJ Chapter

ICSURJ is a local chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice, a national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice.

Formed in the summer of 2016, the Iowa City SURJ chapter hopes to encourage and support white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability. We are endeavoring to be part of this work here in Johnson County through community organizing, mobilizing, education, and partnerships with other racial justice groups locally and nationally.

 ICSURJ also seeks to provide a space to build relationships, skills and political analysis to act for change.
